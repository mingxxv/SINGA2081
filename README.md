# Prologue

In 2081, 60 years into the future, cyberspace has interspersed into reality through advanced VR implants. Websites, and by extension programs, are now physical locations, which can be traversed by simply walking into the area.

However, despite the advancement of technology, megacorporations have taken over the world, opening a divide between the rich and the poor. They have also stolen crucial programming knowledge for manipulating the world, often murdering citizens by simply deleting their tags, rendering them braindead.

S1M0N, a veteran cyberwarrior from 2021, wakes up from cryosleep and is tasked by his rebel employers to break into the megacorp’s CTRLPROG (control program), and steal an ancient library known as jQuery, known by all to be the key in manipulating reality.

Getting caught will mean certain death through the $("s1m0n").remove(); function. Will he succeed?
