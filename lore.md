# PROLOGUE

In 2081, 60 years into the future, cyberspace has interspersed into reality through advanced VR implants. Websites, and by extension programs, are now physical locations, which can be traversed by simply walking into the area.
However, despite the advancement of technology, megacorporations have taken over the world, opening a divide between the rich and the poor. They have also stolen crucial programming knowledge for manipulating the world, often murdering citizens by simply deleting their tags, rendering them braindead.
S1M0N, a veteran cyberwarrior from 2021, wakes up from cryosleep and is tasked by his rebel employers to break into the megacorpâ€™s CTRLPROG (control program), and steal an ancient library known as jQuery, known by all to be the key in manipulating reality.
Getting caught will mean certain death through the $("s1m0n").remove(); function. Will he succeed?

# MAIN ROOM

You hear a faint whirring sound as your VR implant spins up. The room focuses into view. You are in a standard laboratory.

Inside the laboratory, you see a power reactor, study table, AI construct, and chemical store. Where will you go?

# POWER REACTOR

You walk over to the power reactor. The surrounding area is warm, and a faint orange glow emits from the machine.

There is a note stuck on the reactor, and a big red button.

- READ NOTE
"Dave told me to clean the reactor, but I haven't been paid for 2 months. Too bad, I'm not gonna do anything. Who cares about the stupid jQuery library anyway, it's so old!"
*You take a small circuit board wedged behind the note. This looks like a clue!*

- PUSH BUTTON
A siren sounds as the doors of the machine swing open, bathing you in a blinding flash of light. You hear your skin crackling as the radiation reduces you to dust. Game Over.

# STUDY TABLE

The table is littered with notes and drawings, on paper ("How old!" you wonder). There is an iMike standard-issue computer on the table.

- READ NOTES
Despite me repeatedly warning them, corporate refuses to put on greater encryption. I'm done. I'm supposed to hide the unlocker device but I'll do it next time. - 27 July 2081, Researcher Farhan, Justin, Sylvester, et al.
*You take the unlocker device and notice it's missing a few parts*

- TURN ON iMike COMPUTER
As the boot sequence of the computer commences, the police break into the room. Aiming a raygun at you, they fire a .remove() function in your face as you fade from the world. Game Over.

# AI CONSTRUCT

You see an AI, quietly meditating in the corner.

- TALK TO AI
"Greetings, Simon, I'm A5HL3Y. I didn't know people still visited here. From what I can see in your implant, you are not from here. You must be trying to save the world. Sadly I cannot, as I am stuck here in this computer. Please, take this circuit board. It'll help you with your quest."
*A5HL3Y hands you a circuit board. This looks like a clue!*

# CHEMICAL STORE

In the storeroom, there's a small vial left behind on the table.

- SMELL VIAL
The vial smells strongly of bitter almonds. You get a headache and notice blood dripping from your nostrils, as you crumple to the ground like a wet newspaper and expire. Game over.

- READ LABEL
"IF THEY FORCE YOU TO HAND OVER THE CIRCUIT BOARD, DROP THE CIRCUIT INTO THIS VIAL AND DRINK IT. YOU'LL DIE, BUT SO WILL THE BOARD."
*You notice a circuit board stuck under the vial. Looks like you found a clue!*

# KEY ROOM

-> IF CLUECOUNTER !== 4,
The box with the key refuses to open. Go find more clues!

-> IF CLUECOUNTER === 4,
The box opens and the almost-mythical jQuery library appears in your hands. You sprint out of the room and save the day. YOU WIN!
